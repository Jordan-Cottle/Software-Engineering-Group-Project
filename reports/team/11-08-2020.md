    * Python getting better

* Abdullah
    * This week we discussed various aspects of our project during the class meeting. 

    * We also got the chance to assign ourselves to different issues on our github. This was a big step because we were able to individually select issues that we are capable of resolving and helped us visualize all the different pages our application will require. 

    * We also made user stories for this weeks deliverable.

* Abdullah
    * Goals for next week are to collaborate with Bernard on finalizing a visual design for our application, as we are the front end guys. 

    * Another goal is to start resolving Github issues that we assigned ourselves to. This will get us in motion toward a legit product. 

    * Another goal is to have successful meetings during class this week and continue to progress.

## Meeting Agenda

* Do we need an admin panel for administrative tasks?

* Would you like us to keep the same color scheme as the practice examples?
