## Goals

* Our goals from last week were to introduce everyone to our GitHub repositories, clone repositories, assign roles and start the prototyping process by developing a storyboard and wireframe. 
## This Week's Progress

* We had a team meeting last Friday morning that get everyone on the same page and established roles. This was a critical meeting to kickstart our project and make sure everyone is familiar with the project resources.
* I was assigned the role to be a front end developer, UX designer and prototyper.

## Next Week's Goals

* Next week's goals are to continue complete our assigned GitHub issues and hit our sprint deliverables.
