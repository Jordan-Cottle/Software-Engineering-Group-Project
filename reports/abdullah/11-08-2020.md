## Goals


* Our goals from last week were to continue to hit our deliverables on time and progress through the project. 


## This Week's Progress

* This week we discussed various aspects of our project during the class meeting. 

* We also got the chance to assign ourselves to different issues on our github. This was a big step because we were able to individually select issues that we are capable of resolving and helped us visualize all the different pages our application will require. 

* We also made user stories for this weeks deliverable.

## Next Week's Goals

* Goals for next week are to collaborate with Bernard on finalizing a visual design for our application, as we are the front end guys. 

* Another goal is to start resolving Github issues that we assigned ourselves to. This will get us in motion toward a legit product. 

* Another goal is to have successful meetings during class this week and continue to progress.
